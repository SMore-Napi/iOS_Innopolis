# iOS Development with Swift S22 course.
Guided Project - Apple Pie
> Semester 6, 3rd study-year, Innopolis University.

This is the Apple Pie guided project from the **Unit 2** [Develop in Swift Fundamentals. Xcode 13](https://books.apple.com/ru/book/develop-in-swift-fundamentals/id1581182804?l=en) book.

The application is developed for iPad.

Besides the tutorial from the book, it also has implemented stretch goals:
- Learn about the `map` method, and use it in place of the loop that converts the array of characters to an array of strings in `updateUI()`.
- Add a scoring feature that awards points for each correct guess and additional points for each successful word completion.
- Allow multiple players to play, switching turns after each incorrect guess.
- Allow the player to guess the full word using the keyboard instead of guessing one letter at a time using the interface buttons.
- Support letters with special characters. For example, the E button could check for “e” and “é” within a word.
- The keyboard layout doesn’t work well when the app is in one-third Split View mode on iPad—the buttons get flattened. To resolve this issue, use trait variations to adjust the layout when in compact width.
