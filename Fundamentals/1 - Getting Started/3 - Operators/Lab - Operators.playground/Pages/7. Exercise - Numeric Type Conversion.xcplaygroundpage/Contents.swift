## Exercise - Numeric Type Conversion

 Create an integer constant `x` with a value of 10, and a double constant `y` with a value of 3.2. Create a constant `multipliedAsIntegers` equal to `x` times `y`. Does this compile? If not, fix it by converting your `Double` to an `Int` in the mathematical expression. Print the result.
 */
let x: Int = 10
let y: Double = 3.2
let multipliedAsIntegers = x * Int(y)
print(multipliedAsIntegers)
//:  Create a constant `multipliedAsDoubles` equal to `x` times `y`, but this time convert the `Int` to a `Double` in the expression. Print the result.
let multipliedAsDoubles = Double(x) * y
print(multipliedAsDoubles)
//:  Are the values of `multipliedAsIntegers` and `multipliedAsDoubles` different? Print a statement to the console explaining why.
print("Values are different because in the first example we drop .2 part of y value and calculate a result as 10 * 3.\nIn the second example we maintain accuracy, so the result is 10.0 * 3.2")
